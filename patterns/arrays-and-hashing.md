# Arrays and Hashing
 
## Core Ideas
Arrays and Hashing problems typically involve transforming ordered data
into an unordered structure (such as a set or hash map) to enable
constant-time lookups. The most common goal in this pattern is to take a problem that has an obvious "brute force" solution, often a nested loop (O(n^2) time) or sorting (O(n log n) time), and seek an algorithm that runs in O(n) time. This is often achieved by a single pass through the array, storing an intermediate state such as frequency or indices in the form of a hash map or set.
## When to Use This Pattern
This pattern often leads to an optimal solution when:
- Checking for duplicates or existence.
- Grouping elements by certain characteristics.
- Counting or comparing frequencies.
- Order does not matter.
- A brute force solution (eg, nested loops) results in excessive time complexity.
## Common Pitfalls
- Mutating the input array.
- Checking the existence of an element in an array (slower) as opposed to a set or a hash map.
- Using plain objects instead of Map when key type or ordering matters.
- Forgetting edge cases such as duplicates or empty/minimal input.
- Building a linear-time solution with an excessive number of constant-time operations.
## Complexity Patterns
- Most optimal solutions run in O(n) time.
- Achieving a linear solution often results in an intentional trade-off with increased space.
- A brute force solution often runs in O(n^2) time but with O(1) space complexity.
- When order matters, sorting may be required, resulting in an optimal solution in O(nlog(n)) time.
## Notes
- Optimal solutions to each of the 10 problems in this pattern are provided.
- Where applicable, some problems are accompanied by a brute-force/naive solution to demonstrate my reasoning process.
- If more than one solution to a problem is given, solutions are named based on the algorithm used (eg, nestedLoops, indexHashMap).
- If only one solution is given, it is named after the problem.
- All solutions have automated tests with a variety of inputs to cover standard and edge cases.
