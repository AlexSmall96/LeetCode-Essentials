# LeetCode Essentials
A curated collection of LeetCode problems organized by algorithmic patterns,
with TypeScript solutions, time/space complexity analysis, and automated tests.

This repository is being built incrementally as I progress through LeetCode problems, and aims to serve as a reference point for common techniques as well as demonstrate a depth of understanding of a selection of fundamental problems/patterns.

To demonstrate my reasoning process, several problems have both a "brute-force" solution, which is often the more obvious yet slower approach, and an optimal, more time-efficient solution, which requires drawing on common techniques associated with the pattern.

As I progress through the problem sets, a separate README is completed for each
pattern, discussing core ideas, common pitfalls, and common complexity patterns.
